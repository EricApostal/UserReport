# WARNING! THIS IS IN DEVELOPMENT! ANY FUNCTIONALITY IS CURRENTLY A DEMO AND NOT A FULL FEATURE SET!

A system used for reporting users using nextcord (because discord.py is deprecated, RIP)

As it currently stands this project isn't ideal for customizability, but once the full release comes out I plan to find a way to allow customizable button pages, for anyone out there who's interested in using this on their own projects.

I coded this using both VSC and repl.it, so it should work out of the box if you decide to run it in replit, but make sure you set up the config.py file.
