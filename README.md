# WARNING! THIS IS IN DEVELOPMENT! ANY FUNCTIONALITY IS CURRENTLY A DEMO AND NOT A FULL FEATURE SET!

A system used for reporting users using nextcord (because discord.py is deprecated, RIP)

As it currently stands this project isn't ideal for customizability, but once the full release comes out I plan to find a way to allow customizable button pages, for anyone out there who's interested in using this on their own projects.
